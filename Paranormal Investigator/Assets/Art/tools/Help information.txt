Hey, man, I am the painter of these materials. (My English is very bad, this is Google Translate, I hope he didn't let you misunderstand me.)

You don't need to label my name for the material, but if you are willing to do so, I will thank you from the heart. You can sign 東風雨君 or Rain Jun.
By the way, my cat is called Coke.
No, she has not disappeared and there has been no accident. I just want you to know that she is very cute.
Ok, enjoy these materials, if the tool material you need is not there, please leave a comment in the comments section, I will add.
